<p>Following the success of previous events and the importance of the field of computational intelligence, specifically, evolutionary and biologically inspired (artificial neural network, swarm, alife) music, sound, art and design, evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> has become an evo* conference with independent proceedings since 2012. Thus, evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> 2017 is the sixth International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design.
</p><p>
The use of computational intelligence for the development of artistic systems is a recent, exciting and significant area of research. There is a growing interest in the application of these techniques in fields such as: visual art and music generation, analysis, and interpretation; sound synthesis; architecture; video; poetry; design; and other creative tasks.
</p><p>
The main goal of evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> 2017 is to bring together researchers who are using computational intelligence techniques for artistic tasks, providing the opportunity to promote, present and discuss ongoing work in the area.
</p><p>
The event will be held in April, 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, as part of the evo* event.

<h3>Publication Details</h3>
</p><p>
Submissions will be rigorously reviewed for scientific and artistic merit. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as posters at the event and included in the evostar proceedings, published by Springer Verlag in a dedicated volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The acceptance rate at evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> 2016 was 40% for papers accepted for oral presentation, and 24% for poster presentation.
</p><p>
Submitters are strongly encouraged to provide in all papers a link for download of media demonstrating their results, whether music, images, video, or other media types. Links should be anonymised for double-blind review, e.g. using a URL shortening service.


<h3>Topics of interest</h3>

Submissions should concern the use of which use of Computational Intelligence techniques (e.g. Evolutionary Computation, Artificial Life, Machine Learning, Swarm Intelligence) in the generation, analysis and interpretation of art, music, design, architecture and other artistic fields. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<br/>
<strong>Generation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Systems that create drawings, images, animations, sculptures, poetry, text, designs, webpages, buildings, etc.;</li>
<li>Systems that create musical pieces, sounds, instruments, voices, sound effects, sound analysis, etc.;</li>
<li>Systems that create artifacts such as game content, architecture, furniture, based on aesthetic and functional criteria.</li>
<li>Robotic-Based evolutionary art and music;</li>
<li>Other related artificial intelligence or generative techniques in the fields of computer music, computer art, etc.;</li>
</ul>

<strong>Theory</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computational aesthetics, experimental aesthetics; emotional response, surprise, novelty;</li>
<li>Representation techniques;</li>
<li>Surveys of the current state-of-the-art in the area; identification of weaknesses and strengths; comparative analysis and classification;</li>
<li>Validation methodologies;</li>
<li>Studies on the applicability of these techniques to related areas;</li>
<li>New models designed to promote the creative potential of biologically inspired computation;</li>
</ul>

<strong>Computer Aided Creativity and computational creativity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Systems in which computational intelligence is used to promote the creativity of a human user;</li>
<li>New ways of integrating the user in the evolutionary cycle;</li>
<li>Analysis and evaluation of: the artistic potential of biologically inspired art and music; the artistic processes inherent to these approaches; the resulting artefacts;</li>
<li>Collaborative distributed artificial art environments;</li>
</ul>

<strong>Automation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Techniques for automatic fitness assignment</li>
<li>Systems in which an analysis or interpretation of the artworks is used in conjunction with computational intelligence techniques to produce novel objects;</li>
<li>Systems that resort to computational intelligence approaches to perform the analysis of image, music, sound, sculpture, or some other types of artistic object or resource.</li>
</ul>
