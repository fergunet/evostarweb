<p><strong>Title:</strong> Evolutionary Program Sketching

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Iwo Błądek, Krzysztof Krawiec

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Program synthesis can be posed as a satisfiability problem and approached

with generic SAT solvers. Only short programs can be however synthesized in this

way. Program sketching by Solar-Lezama assumes that a human provides a partial

program (sketch), and that synthesis takes place only within the uncompleted parts of

that program. This allows synthesizing programs that are overall longer, while

maintaining manageable computational effort. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary

Program Sketching (EPS), in which the role of sketch provider is handed over to

genetic programming (GP). A GP algorithm evolves a population of partial programs,

which are being completed by a solver while evaluated. We consider several variants

of EPS, which vary in program terminals used for completion (constants, variables, or

both) and in the way the completion outcomes are propagated to future generations.

When applied to a range of benchmarks, EPS outperforms the conventional GP, also

when the latter is given similar time budget.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Exploring Fitness and Edit Distance of Mutated Python Programs

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Saemundur O. Haraldsson, John R. Woodward, Alexander I.E. Brownlee,

David Cairns

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genetic Improvement (GI) is the process of using computational search

techniques to improve existing software e.g. in terms of execution time, power

consumption or correctness. As in most heuristic search algorithms, the search is

guided by fitness with GI searching the space of program variants of the original

software. The relationship between the program space and fitness is seldom simple

and often quite difficult to analyse. This paper makes a preliminary analysis of GI's

fitness distance measure on program repair with three small Python programs. Each

program undergoes incremental mutations while the change in fitness as measured by

proportion of tests passed is monitored. We conclude that the fitnesses of these

programs often does not change with single mutations and we also confirm the

inherent discreteness of bug fixing fitness functions. Although our findings cannot be

assumed to be general for other software they provide us with interesting directions

for further investigation.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Differentiable Genetic Programming

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Dario Izzo, Francesco Biscani, Alessio Mereta

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce the use of high order automatic differentiation, implemented

via the algebra of truncated Taylor polynomials, in genetic programming. Using the

Cartesian Genetic Programming encoding we obtain a high-order Taylor

representation of the program output that is then used to back-propagate errors during

learning. The resulting machine learning framework is called differentiable Cartesian

Genetic Programming (dCGP). In the context of symbolic regression, dCGP offers a

new approach to the long unsolved problem of constant representation in GP

expressions. On several problems of increasing complexity we find that dCGP is able

to find the exact form of the symbolic expression as well as the constants values. We

also demonstrate the use of dCGP to solve a large class of differential equations and

to find prime integrals of dynamical systems, presenting, in both cases, results that

confirm the efficacy of our approach.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Evolving Game State Features from Raw Pixels

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Baozhu Jia, Marc Ebner

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> General video game playing is the art of designing artificial intelligence

programs that are capable of playing different video games with little domain

knowledge. One of the great challenges is how to capture game state features from

different video games in a general way. The main contribution of this paper is to apply

genetic programming to evolve game state features from raw pixels. A voting method

is implemented to determine the actions of the game agent. Three different video

games are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm: Missile Command,

Frogger, and Space Invaders. The results show that genetic programming is able to

find useful game state features for all three games.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Emergent Tangled Graph Representations for Atari Game Playing Agents

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen Kelly, Malcolm I. Heywood

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Organizing code into coherent programs and relating different programs to

each other represents an underlying requirement for scaling genetic programming to

more difficult task domains. Assuming a model in which policies are defined by teams

of programs, in which team and program are represented using independent

populations and coevolved, has previously been shown to support the development of

variable sized teams. In this work, we generalize the approach to provide a complete

framework for organizing multiple teams into arbitrarily deep/wide structures through a

process of continuous evolution; hereafter the Tangled Program Graph (TPG).

Benchmarking is conducted using a subset of 20 games from the Arcade Learning

Environment (ALE), an Atari 2600 video game emulator. The games considered here

correspond to those in which deep learning was unable to reach a threshold of play

consistent with that of a human. Information provided to the learning agent is limited to

that which a human would experience. That is, screen capture sensory input, Atari

joystick actions, and game score. The performance of the proposed approach

exceeds that of deep learning in 15 of the 20 games, with 7 of the 15 also exceeding

that associated with a human level of competence. Moreover, in contrast to solutions

from deep learning, solutions discovered by TPG are also very `sparse'. Rather than

assuming thatall of the state space contributes to every decision, each action in TPG

is resolved following execution of a subset of an individual's graph. This results in

significantly lower computational requirements for model building than presently the

case for deep learning.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> A General Feature Engineering Wrapper for Machine Learning Using ε-Lexicase

Survival

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> William La Cava, Jason Moore

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose a general wrapper for feature learning that interfaces with other

machine learning methods to compose effective data representations. The proposed

feature engineering wrapper (FEW) uses genetic programming to represent and

evolve individual features tailored to the machine learning method with which it is

paired. In order to maintain feature diversity, ε-lexicase survival is introduced, a

method based on ε-lexicase selection. This survival method preserves semantically

unique individuals in the population based on their ability to solve difficult subsets of

training cases, thereby yielding a population of uncorrelated features. We

demonstrate FEW with five different off-the-shelf machine learning methods and test it

on a set of real-world and synthetic regression problems with dimensions varying

across three orders of magnitude. The results show that FEW is able to improve

model test predictions across problems for several ML methods. We discuss and test

the scalability of FEW in comparison to other feature composition strategies, most

notably polynomial feature expansion.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Visualising the Search Landscape of the Triangle Program

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> William B. Langdon, Nadarajen Veerapen, Gabriela Ochoa

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> High order mutation analysis of a software engineering benchmark,

including schema and local optima networks, suggests program improvements may

not be as hard to find as is often assumed. 1) Bit-wise genetic building blocks are not

deceptive and can lead to all global optima. 2) There are many neutral networks,

plateaux and local optima, nevertheless in most cases near the human written C

source code there are hill climbing routes including neutral moves to solutions.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> RANSAC-GP: Dealing with Outliers in Symbolic Regression with Genetic

Programming

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Uriel López, Leonardo Trujillo, Yuliana Martinez, Pierrick Legrand, Enrique

Naredo, Sara Silva

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genetic programming (GP) has been shown to be a powerful tool for

automatic modeling and program induction. It is often used to solve difficult symbolic

regression tasks, with many examples in real-world domains. However, the

robustness of GP-based approaches has not been substantially studied. In particular,

the present work deals with the issue of outliers, data in the training set that represent

severe errors in the measuring process. In general, a datum is considered an outlier

when it sharply deviates from the true behavior of the system of interest. GP

practitioners know that such data points usually bias the search and produce

inaccurate models. Therefore, this work presents a hybrid methodology based on the

RAndom SAmpling Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm and GP, which we call RANSAC-
GP. RANSAC is an approach to deal with outliers in parameter estimation problems,

widely used in computer vision and related fields. On the other hand, this work

presents the first application of RANSAC to symbolic regression with GP, with

impressive results. The proposed algorithm is able to deal with extreme amounts of

contamination in the training set, evolving highly accurate models even when the

amount of outliers reaches 90%.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Symbolic Regression on Network Properties

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Märtens, Fernando Kuipers, Piet Van Mieghem

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Networks are continuously growing in complexity, which creates challenges

for determining their most important characteristics. While analytical bounds are often

too conservative, the computational effort of algorithmic approaches does not scale

well with network size. This work uses Cartesian Genetic Programming for symbolic

regression to evolve mathematical equations that relate network properties directly to

the eigenvalues of network adjacency and Laplacian matrices. In particular, we show

that these eigenvalues are powerful features to evolve approximate equations for the

network diameter and the isoperimetric number, which are hard to compute

algorithmically. Our experiments indicate a good performance of the evolved

equations for several real-world networks and we demonstrate how the generalization

power can be influenced by the selection of training networks and feature sets.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Evolving Time-Invariant Dispatching Rules in Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic

Programming

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Mei, Su Nguyen, Mengjie Zhang

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genetic Programming (GP) has achieved success in evolving dispatching

rules for job shop scheduling problems, particularly in dynamic environments.

However, there is still great potential to improve the performance of GP. One

challenge that is yet to be addressed is the huge search space. In this paper, we

propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of

GP. The new approach is based on a newly defined time-invariance property of

dispatching rules, which is derived from the idea of translational invariance from

machine learning. Then, we develop a new terminal selection scheme to guarantee

the time-invariance throughout the GP process. The experimental studies show that

by considering the time-invariance, GP can achieve much better rules in a much

shorter time.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Strategies for Improving the Distribution of Random Function Outputs in GSGP

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiz Otavio V. B. Oliveira, Felipe Casadei, Gisele Pappa

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the last years, different approaches have been proposed to introduce

semantic information to genetic programming. In particular, the geometric semantic

genetic programming (GSGP) and the interesting properties of its evolutionary

operators have gotten the attention of the community. This paper is interested in the

use of GSGP to solve symbolic regression problems, where semantics is defined by

the output set generated by a given individual when applied to the training cases. In

this scenario, both mutation and crossover operators defined with fitness function

based on Manhattan distance use randomly built functions to generate offspring.

However, the outputs of these random functions are not guaranteed to be uniformly

distributed in the semantic space, as the functions are generated considering the

syntactic space. We hypothesize that the non-uniformity of the semantics of these

functions may bias the search, and propose three different standard normalization

techniques to improve the distribution of the outputs of these random functions over

the semantic space. The results are compared with a popular strategy that uses a

logistic function as a wrapper to the outputs, and show that the strategies tested can

improve the results of the previous method. The experimental analysis also indicates

that a more uniform distribution of the semantics of these functions does not

necessarily imply in better results in terms of test error.

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz P. Pawlak, Krzysztof Krawiec

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> We identify a novel application of Genetic Programming to automatic

synthesis of mathematical programming (MP) models for business processes. Given a

set of examples of states of a business process, the proposed Genetic Constraint

Synthesis (GenetiCS) method constructs well-formed constraints for an MP model.

The form of synthesized constraints (e.g., linear or polynomial) can be chosen

accordingly to the nature of the process and the desired type of MP problem. In

experimental part, we verify syntactic and semantic fidelity of the synthesized models

to the actual benchmark models of varying complexity. The obtained symbolic models

of constraints can be combined with an objective function of choice, fed into an off-
shelf MP solver, and optimized.

and Criticality Ranking

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Reichensdörfer, Dirk Odenthal, Dirk Wollherr

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> In process control it is essential that disturbances and parameter

uncertainties do not affect the process in a negative way. Simultaneously optimizing

an objective function for different scenarios can be solved in theory by evaluating

candidate solutions on all scenarios. This is not feasible in real-world applications,

where the scenario space often forms a continuum. A traditional approach is to

approximate this evaluation using Monte Carlo sampling. To overcome the difficulty of

choosing an appropriate sampling count and to reduce evaluations of low-quality

solutions, a novel approach using Wilson scoring and criticality ranking within a

grammatical evolution framework is presented. A nonlinear spring mass system is

considered as benchmark example from robust control. The method is tested against

Monte Carlo sampling and the results are compared to a backstepping controller. It is

shown that the method is capable of outperforming state of the art methods.

Dimensional Data

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Binh Tran, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Feature construction is a pre-processing technique to create new features

with better discriminating ability from the original features. Genetic programming (GP)

has been shown to be a prominent technique for this task. However, applying GP to

high-dimensional data is still challenging due to the large search space. Feature

clustering groups similar features into clusters, which can be used for dimensionality

reduction by choosing representative features from each cluster to form the feature

subset. Feature clustering has been shown promising in feature selection; but has not

been investigated in feature construction for classification. This paper presents the

first work of utilising feature clustering in this area. We propose a cluster-based GP

feature construction method called CGPFC which uses feature clustering to improve

the performance of GP for feature construction on high-dimensional data. Results on

eight high-dimensional datasets with varying difficulties show that the CGPFC

constructed features perform better than the original full feature set and features

constructed by the standard GP constructor based on the whole feature set.

Programming for Symbolic Regression

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Chen, Bing Xue, Yi Mei, Mengjie Zhang

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent research shows that incorporating semantic knowledge into the

genetic programming (GP) evolutionary process can improve its performance. This

work proposes an angle-aware mating scheme for geometric semantic crossover in

GP for symbolic regression. The angle-awareness guides the crossover operating on

parents which have a large angle between their relative semantics to the target

semantics. The proposed idea of angle-awareness has been incorporated into one

state-of-the-art geometric crossover, the locally geometric semantic crossover. The

experimental results show that, compared with locally geometric semantic crossover

and the regular GP crossover,

the locally geometric crossover with angle-awareness not only has a significantly

better learning performance but also has a notable generalisation gain on unseen test

data. Further analysis has been conducted to see the difference between the angle

distribution of crossovers with and without angle-awareness, which confirms that the

angle-awareness changes the original distribution of angles by decreasing the number

of parents with zero degree while increasing their counterparts with large angles,

leading to better performance.

Classification Pipelines

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex G. C. de Sá, Walter José G. S. Pinto, Luiz Otavio V. B. Oliveira, Gisele

Pappa

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Automatic Machine Learning is a growing area of machine learning that has

a similar objective to the area of hyper-heuristics: to automatically recommend

optimized pipelines, algorithms or appropriate parameters to specific tasks without

much dependency on user knowledge. The background knowledge required to solve

the task at hand is actually embedded into a search mechanism that builds

personalized solutions to the task. Following this idea, this paper proposes RECIPE

(REsilient ClassifIcation Pipeline Evolution), a framework based on grammar-based

genetic programming that builds customized classification pipelines. The framework is

flexible enough to receive different grammars and can be easily extended to other

machine learning tasks. RECIPE overcomes the drawbacks of previous evolutionary-
based frameworks, such as generating invalid individuals, and organizes a high

number of possible suitable data pre-processing and classification methods into a

grammar. Results of f-measure obtained by RECIPE are compared to those two state-
of-the-art methods, and shown to be as good as or better than those previously

reported in the literature. RECIPE represents a first step towards a complete

framework for dealing with different machine learning tasks with the minimum required

human intervention.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> A Grammar Design Pattern for Arbitrary Program Synthesis Problems in Genetic

Programming

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Forstenlechner, David Fagan, Miguel Nicolau, Michael O'Neill

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Grammar Guided Genetic Programming has been applied to many problem

domains. It is well suited to tackle program synthesis, as it has the capability to evolve

code in arbitrary languages. Nevertheless, grammars designed to evolve code have

always been tailored to specific problems resulting in bespoke grammars, which

makes them difficult to reuse. In this study a more general approach to grammar

design in the program synthesis domain is presented. The approach undertaken is to

create a grammar for each data type of a language and combine these grammars for

the problem at hand, without having to tailor a grammar for every single problem. The

approach can be applied to arbitrary problem instances of program synthesis and can

be used with any programming language. The approach is also extensible to use

libraries available in a given language. The grammars presented can be applied to

any grammar-based Genetic Programming approach and make it easy for researches

to rerun experiments or test new problems. The approach is tested on a suite of

benchmark problems and compared to PushGP, as it is the only GP system that has

presented results on a wide range of benchmark problems. The object of this study is

to match or outperform PushGP on these problems without tuning grammars to solve

each specific problem.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Improving the Tartarus Problem as a Benchmark in Genetic Programming

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas D. Griffiths, Anikó Ekárt

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> For empirical research on computer algorithms, it is essential to have a set

of benchmark problems on which the relative performance of different methods and

their applicability can be assessed. In the majority of computational research fields

there are established sets of benchmark problems; however, the field of genetic

programming lacks a similarly rigorously defined set of benchmarks. There is a strong

interest within the genetic programming community to develop a suite of benchmarks.

Following recent surveys, the desirable characteristics of a benchmark problem are

now better defined. In this paper the Tartarus problem is proposed as a tunably

difficult benchmark problem for use in Genetic Programming. The justification for this

proposal is presented, together with guidance on its usage as a benchmark.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> A New Subgraph Crossover for Cartesian Genetic Programming

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Kalkreuth, Günter Rudolph, Andre Droschinsky

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> While tree-based Genetic Programming is often used with crossover,

Cartesian Genetic Programming is mostly used only with mutation as genetic

operator. In this paper, a new crossover technique is introduced which recombines

subgraphs of two selected graphs. Experiments on symbolic regression, boolean

functions and image operator design problems indicate that the use of the subgraph

crossover improves the search performance of Cartesian Genetic Programming. A

preliminary comparison to a former proposed crossover technique indicates that the

subgraph crossover performs better on our tested problems.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> A Comparative Study of Different Grammar-based Genetic Programming

Approaches

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Nuno Lourenço, Joaquim Ferrer, Francisco B. Pereira, Ernesto Costa

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Grammars are useful formalisms to specify constraints, and not

surprisingly, they have attracted the attention of Evolutionary Computation (EC)

researchers to enforce problem restrictions. Context-Free-Grammar GP (CFG-GP)

established the foundations for the application of grammars in Genetic Programming

(GP), whilst Grammatical Evolution (GE) popularised the use of these approaches,

becoming one of the most used GP variants. However, studies have shown that GE

suffers from issues that have impact on its performance. To minimise these issues,

several extensions have been proposed, which made the distinction between GE and

CFG-GP less noticeable. Another direction was followed by Structured Grammatical

Evolution (SGE) that maintains the separation between genotype and phenotype from

GE, but overcomes most of its issues. Our goal is to perform a comparative study

between CFG-GP, GE and SGE to examine their relative performance. The results

show that in most of the selected benchmarks, CFG-GP and SGE have a similar

performance, showing that SGE is a good alternative to GE.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> A Comparative Analysis of Dynamic Locality and Redundancy in Grammatical

Evolution

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong>Eric Medvet

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> The most salient feature of Grammatical Evolution (GE) is a procedure

which maps genotypes to phenotypes using the grammar production rules; however,

the search effectiveness of GE may be affected by low locality and high redundancy,

which can prevent GE to comply with the basic principle that offspring should inherit

some traits from their parents. Indeed, many studies previously investigated the

locality and redundancy of GE as originally proposed in [1]. In this paper, we extend

those results by considering redundancy and locality during the evolution, rather than

statically, hence trying to understand if and how they are influenced by the selective

pressure determined by the fitness. Moreover, we consider not only the original GE

formulation, but three other variants proposed later (BGE, piGE, and SGE). We

experimentally find that there is an interaction between locality/redundancy and other

evolution-related measures, namely diversity and growth of individual size. In

particular, the combined action of the crossover operator and the genotype-phenotype

mapper makes SGE less redundant at the beginning of the evolution, but with very

high redundancy after some generations, due to the low phenotype diversity.

</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> On Evolutionary Approximation of Sigmoid Function for HW/SW Embedded

Systems

<br/><strong>Authors:</strong> Milos Minarik, Lukas Sekanina

<br/><strong>Abstract:</strong> Providing machine learning capabilities on low cost electronic devices is a

challenging goal especially in the context of the Internet of Things paradigm. In order

to deliver high performance machine intelligence on low power devices, suitable

hardware accelerators have to be introduced. In this paper, we developed a method

enabling to evolve a hardware implementation together with a corresponding software

controller for key components of smart embedded systems. The proposed approach is

based on a multi-objective design space exploration conducted by means of extended

linear genetic programming. The approach was evaluated in the task of approximate

sigmoid function design which is an important component of hardware

implementations of neural networks. During these experiments, we automatically rediscovered some approximate sigmoid functions known from the literature. The

method was implemented as an extension of an existing platform supporting

concurrent evolution of hardware and software of embedded systems.
