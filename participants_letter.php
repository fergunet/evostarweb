   </div>

<p>
Letters of invitation to EvoStar 2018 for the purposes of obtaining a visa to enter Italy are only prepared for authors of accepted papers, or for genuine conference researchers working or studying at recognised academic institutions who are active in relevant subjects.  These invitations are issued at the discretion of the conference organisers.
</p>
<p>
Letters of invitation are only sent when <strong class="red">registration fees have been paid in full</strong>.  Applications should be made by <strong class="red">28 February 2018 </strong> to allow time for processing by consular authorities who may take weeks to issue a visa. Please check with your local Italian consular office to know the correct visa application procedure in your country, as there are local differences.
</p>
 
<p>
A letter of invitation can only be obtained by submitting <strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/invitationrequest" class="red">this form</a></strong>.  Each author requiring a visa should complete their own form, since individual letters of invitation are prepared.  It may take up to 10 working days for an invitation letter to be sent following your application. 
</p>
 
<p>
Do not contact the conference organisers unless you have a particular enquiry, otherwise you will simply be re-directed to the form.  Genuine questions for clarification purposes can be sent to the <a href="mailto:evostar2018@gmail.com&subject=EvoStar Letter of Invitation">EvoStar Coordinator</a>.  Please include “EvoStar Letter of Invitation” in the subject header of your email.
