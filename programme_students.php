<p>
We will be holding a reception for student attendees on Tuesday the evening of the  <strong>23rd of April</strong>, just before the conference commences. Based on our successful event last year, this will provide an opportunity to tell others about your research and meet other students working in areas similar to yours.
</p>
 
<p>
We will also form up the teams for the 2019 Evostar scavenger hunt, which will take place during the conference.
</p>
 
<p>
The reception will be held at the <a href="https://www.moritzbastei.de/en/startseite">MoritzBastei</a> from  <strong>18:30 until 19:30</strong>. Full directions can be
