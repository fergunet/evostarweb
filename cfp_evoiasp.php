 <h2>Evolutionary Computation in Image Analysis, Signal Processing
and Pattern Recognition</h2>
<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>
<?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?>

<p>
Evolutionary algorithms have been shown to be tools which can be used
effectively in the development of systems (software or hardware) for image 
analysis, signal processing and pattern recognition in complex domains of
high industrial and social relevance.
</p>
<p>
The longest-running of all EvoApplications tracks, Evo<span class="red">IASP</span> started in 1999
as a workshop, the first event ever specifically dedicated to the
applications of evolutionary computation to image analysis and signal
processing (IASP), as well as to Pattern Recognition.
</p>
<p>
Evo<span class="red">IASP</span> aims to offer European and non-European researchers in those
fields, as well as people from industry, an opportunity to present
their latest research and to discuss current developments and
applications, besides fostering closer future interaction between members
of the three scientific communities.
