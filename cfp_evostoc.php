<h2>Evolutionary Algorithms and Meta-heuristics in Stochastic and Dynamic Environments</h2>
<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>
<?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?>

Following the success of previous events and the importance of the 

field of evolutionary and bio-inspired computation for dynamic 

optimization problems, the Evo<span class="red">STOC</span> 2018 will run its 15th edition 

as a track of EvoApplications, the 20th European Conference on the 

Applications of Evolutionary and bio-inspired Computation. 

<h3>PUBLICATION DETAILS</h3> 

Submissions will be rigorously reviewed by at least three members 

of the program committee. Accepted papers will be presented orally 

at the event and included in the EvoApplications proceedings, 

published by Springer Verlag in a dedicated volume of the Lecture 

Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and 

not published elsewhere. The submissions will be peer reviewed. 

The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on 

the basis of the reviewersâ€™ comments and will be asked to send a 

camera-ready version of their manuscripts. At least one author of 

each accepted work has to register for the conference and attend the 

conference and present the work. 

 

<h3> TOPICS OF INTEREST </h3> 

Many real-world optimisation problems are characterised by some 

types of uncertainty that need to be accounted for by the algorithms 

used to solve the problems. These uncertainties include noise (noisy 

optimisation), approximations (surrogate-assisted optimisation), 

dynamics (dynamic/online optimisation problems) as well as the 

requirements for robust solutions (robust optimisation). Dealing with 

these uncertainties has become increasingly popular in stochastic 

optimisation in recent years and a variety of new techniques have 

been proposed. The objective of Evo<span class="red">STOC</span> is to foster interest in 

metaheuristics and stochastic optimisation for stochastic and dynamic 

environments and to provide an opportunity for researchers to meet 

and to present and discuss the state-of-the-arts in the field. 

Evo<span class="red">STOC</span> accepts contributions, both empirical and theoretical in 

nature, for any work relating to nature-inspired, metaheuristics and 

stochastic techniques applied to a domain characterised by one or 

more types of uncertainty.
