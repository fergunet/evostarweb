The <strong>EVOSTAR CONFERENCE DINNER</strong> will be held on Thursday, 5 April at <a href="http://www.ristorantealcavallinobianco.it/">Al Cavallino
Bianco</a> approximately 45 minutes outside of Parma and located beside the river Po. On
the same site for 100 years, the Spigaroli family has developed the Al Cavallino Bianco
restaurant from its simple origins of ferry crossing cafe, and it now offers gastronomic
specialties from the local area.
<p>
Coaches will depart between 18:00 and 18:30 near the conference venue and will drop
you to visit the restaurant cellars where local cheeses and hams are cured. This is a
unique opportunity to see and smell the real aging process famous in the Emilia Romagna
area. Afterwards a typical dinner of local dishes will be served. If you have indicated any
special diets at registration, please make yourself known to the conference coordinator
when you enter the restaurant so you can be identified and served appropriately. It is
important to remember that <strong>YOU MUST BRING YOUR DINNER TICKET WITH YOU TO
GET ON THE BUS</strong>.

<h3>OPTIONAL LOCAL TOUR ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON</h3>
For those staying on Friday afternoon, an optional visit to a few famous sites in Parma has
been arranged. This includes the not-to- be-missed <a href="http://turismo.comune.parma.it/en/thematic-channels/discover-the-area/art-and-culture/villas-historical-residences-and-theaters/farnese-theatre?set_language=en">Teatro Farnese</a>, a beautiful 17 th
century theatre which has seen its share of real life drama in 400 years (fires, floodings,
bombings). Built entirely of wood, it creaks its history as you mount the impressive
proscenium stage to imagine performing in front of dukes and princes sitting in the
horseshoe shaped double-tiered loggias illuminated by Palladian windows above. The
size, the sounds, the smells - all are impressive. Then the tour continues to the imposing
<a href="http://www.piazzaduomoparma.com/en/cattedrale/">Piazza Duomo Parma</a> standing for 900 years with a wealth of art amassed over centuries.
The cupola by Correggio and the freschi by Gambara are among many other great works
of art that will leave you in awe. The walking tour leaves at approximately 15:15 from the
conference venue and is expected to finish about 17:30 or thereabouts. Tickets are 10
euro per person, and are available from the conference desk, cash only please.
