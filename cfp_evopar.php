 <h2>Parallel Architectures and Distributed Infrastructures</h2>
<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>
<?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?>
    <p>There is growing interest in running evolutionary computation on Parallel 
      and Distributed Computing Infrastructures. A number of technologies are 
      already available. These include Grid and Cloud Computing, Internet Computing 
      (e.g. seti@home, boinc), General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing 
      Units (GPGPU), multi-core and many-core architectures and supercomputers. 
      Although they are routinely used for running computing intensive applications, 
      considerable skill is required to get the best from them. The experimenter 
      has to consider scheduling, porting of applications, communication topologies, 
      new parallel models and architectures, cache and memory management optimization, 
      preemptive multitasking and simultaneous multi threading and even energy 
      consumption. Also, the experimenter may need to change their evolutionary 
      algorithm to fully exploit these new tools. At Evo<span class="red">Par</span> scientists and engineers 
      will gather to share and exchange their experiences, discuss challenges, 
      and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on all aspects of the 
      application of evolutionary algorithms for improving parallel architectures 
      and distributed computing Infrastructures. Evo<span class="red">PAR</span> will assist the two-way 
      flow of ideas between the parallel computing community and the EC community.

    <h2>PUBLICATION DETAILS</h2>
    <p>Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of Evo<span class="red">Star</span>, 
      published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 
      which will be available at the Conference.Submissions must be original and 
      not published elsewhere. The submissions will be peer reviewed by at least 
      three members of the program committee. The authors of accepted papers will 
      have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers comments and will 
      be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts. At least one 
      author of each accepted work has to register for the conference and attend 
      the conference and present the work.The reviewing process will be double-blind, 
      please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper. </p>
