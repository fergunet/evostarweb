 <h2>Parallel Architectures and Distributed Infrastructures</h2>
<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>
<?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?>
    <p>There is growing interest in running evolutionary computation on Parallel 
      and Distributed Computing Infrastructures. A number of technologies are 
      already available. These include Grid and Cloud Computing, Internet Computing 
      (e.g. seti@home, boinc), General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing 
      Units (GPGPU), multi-core and many-core architectures and supercomputers. 
      Although they are routinely used for running computing intensive applications, 
      considerable skill is required to get the best from them. The experimenter 
      has to consider scheduling, porting of applications, communication topologies, 
      new parallel models and architectures, cache and memory management optimization, 
      preemptive multitasking and simultaneous multi threading and even energy 
      consumption. Also, the experimenter may need to change their evolutionary 
      algorithm to fully exploit these new tools. At Evo<span class="red">Par</span> scientists and engineers 
      will gather to share and exchange their experiences, discuss challenges, 
      and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on all aspects of the 
      application of evolutionary algorithms for improving parallel architectures 
      and distributed computing Infrastructures. Evo<span class="red">PAR</span> will assist the two-way 
      flow of ideas between the parallel computing community and the EC community.
