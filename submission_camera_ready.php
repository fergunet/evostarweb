<p>
   <strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: To be published in the proceedings, at least one author must REGISTER and PAY for the conference (before INSERT DATE HERE), and also ATTEND to present his/her paper.</strong> 
</p>
Please follow Springer's LNCS instructions when preparing your paper.

<a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</a>

<p>Remember that references should be ordered by appearance in the paper, using 'splncs.bst'
as BibTeX style (if you use LaTeX) or generating a list with this order if
you use Word.</p>
<p>There are strict page limits for all of the 4 conferences collectively known as EvoStar</p>
<p>
<strong>16 pages</strong>
</p>
<br/>




<strong>Please ensure that submissions are directed to the relevant track. </strong>

Papers which are not formatted according to those guidelines, or do not respect the page limit, risk being excluded from the proceedings.

Submit your final camera-ready paper NO LATER than

<strong><span class="red">18 January 2016</span></strong>

through the appropriate submission system at

<ul>
<li>Euro<span class="red">GP</span>: TBA </li>
<li>Evo<span class="red">COP</span>: TBA </li>
<li>Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span>: TBA </li>
<li>Evo<span class="red">Applications</span>: TBA </li>

using your id and password.

<p>
Springer reprocesses all the contributions, meaning that you have to provide all source files and figures.
</p>

You should prepare a single tgz or zip-file containing a single directory with all of the necessary files (and all the necessary .sty files).

The name of the directory should be the last name of the first
author.

The directory has to contain:

<ul>
<li><strong>Latex .tex file</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>Latex .bib and .bbl files</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>All figures</strong>:.png, .jpg, .pdf (using pdflatex) or .ps, .eps (using latex).</li>

<li><strong>Final .pdf file</strong> (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>.rtf file</strong> if another word processing program other than Latex was used (named with the last name of the first author).</li>

<li><strong>authors.txt</strong> : This file should have one line for each author of the paper using the following format:

<br/>
<em>[first names of first author] [last name of first author] [email]<br/>
[first names of second author] [last name of second author] [email]<br/></em>
<br/>
Please mark the contact author with * at the end of the line.<br/><br/>

Example of a paper authored by Mario Rossi and Jos&eacute; Salgado:<br/>
<em>Mario Rossi mario.rossi@myuni.xy<br/>
Jos\'e Salgado jsagado@hisuni.yx*<br/></em>
<br/>
Note that in authors.txt any accent/special characters must be
written in Latex style, e.g.: Jos\'e
</li>
<li><strong>abstract.txt</strong> : This file should have the following structure:</li>

first line: title of the paper<br/>
second line: blank<br/>
remaining lines: abstract of the paper (in ASCII without line breaks).</br>
<li><strong>Scanned signed copyright</strong> form as PDF using the following filename:</li>

<em>[last_name_of_first_author]cr.pdf<br/></em>
(one author may sign on behalf of all authors of a paper).<br/>

Download your specific form from:
<ul>
<li><a href="pdfs/LNCS-Springer_Copyright_Form_EuroGP_2016.pdf">Euro<span class="red">GP</span> copyright form</a></li>
<li><a href="pdfs/LNCS-Springer_Copyright_Form_EvoCOP_2016.pdf">Evo<span class="red">COP</span> copyright form</a></li>
<li><a href="pdfs/LNCS-Springer_Copyright_Form_EvoMUSART_2016.pdf">Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> copyright form</a></li>
<li><a href="pdfs/LNCS-Springer_Copyright_Form_EvoAPPS_2016.pdf">Evo<span class="red">Applications</span> copyright form</a></li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>


Other considerations:<br/>
<ul>
<li>When submitting a paper, please specify at least <strong>three keyworkds</strong>.</li>
<li>EvoAPP's authors, please be sure to specify a <strong>secondary topic</strong>, i.e., the second more relevant track.</li>
<li>In camera ready, and using LaTeX, authors should fill up \authorrunning and \titlerunning, without activating them (commented).</li>
Example:<br/>
<em>%\authorrunning{A. Uthor et al.}</em><br/>
<em>%\titlerunning{My beautiful paper}</em><br/>
<li>In camera ready, authors should not enable page numbering.</li>
<li>If using LaTeX, please include a bibtex file, even if the bibliography is embedded into the source .tex file(s).</li>
</ul>



<p>
When preparing your camera-ready, please make sure that you omit all headers (no page numbers, no running title, no running
authors). Springer will
activate running title and authors in reformatting the proceedings. Therefore, specify running title and running authors in the .tex source using comments. For Word users, add the
specifications without activating headers.
</p>

<p>Authors not following the instructions may result in the paper being excluded from the proceedings.</p>
