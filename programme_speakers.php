<strong>Bio:</strong><em> 


Kenneth A. De Jong received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of

Michigan in 1975. He joined George Mason University in 1984 and is currently a Professor

Emeritus of Computer Science, head of the <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab">Evolutionary Computation Laboratory</a>, and

Associate Director of the <a href="http://www.krasnow.gmu.edu/">Krasnow Institute</a>. His research interests include genetic

algorithms, evolutionary computation, machine learning, and complex adaptive systems.

He is currently involved in research projects involving the development of new evolutionary

algorithm (EA) theory, the use of EAs as high-performance optimization techniques, and

the application of EAs to the problem of learning task programs in domains such as robot

navigation and game playing. He is an active member of the Evolutionary Computation

research community and has been involved in organizing many of the workshops and

conferences in this area. He is the founding editor-in- chief of the journal Evolutionary

Computation (MIT Press), and a member of the board of ACM SIGEVO. He is the

recipient of an IEEE Pioneer award in the field of Evolutionary Computation and a lifetime

achievement award from the Evolutionary Programming Society.

<h2>
Evolutionary Computation in Industry: A Realistic Overview by <span class="red">Arthur Kordon</span>
	</h2>

<p> <span class="red">Closing Talk on Friday 21 April 2017</span></p>

<p>
	<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
This talk will give a realistic overview of the current state of the art of EC in industry based

on 20 years experience from applying these systems in several large global corporations.

It includes a short analysis of the differences between academic and industrial research,

examples of the key implementation areas of EC in manufacturing and business, a

discussion about the main factors for success and failure of industrial EC systems, and an

estimate of the projected industrial needs that may drive future applications.

<strong>Bio:</strong><em> 

Dr. Arthur Kordon is CEO of Kordon Consulting LLC and an internationally recognized

expert in applying data science, advanced analytics and computational intelligence in

industry. The list of his current projects for large corporations includes: customer churn

analysis, classifying patterns in office occupancy, nonlinear price forecasting, etc. In his

previous position as Advanced Analytics Leader at Dow Chemical, Dr. Kordon has

successfully applied advanced analytics solutions in various business problems in

forecasting, business cycles analysis, price elasticity analysis, fraud detection in Auditing,

etc. He also successfully introduced several novel technologies for improved

manufacturing and new product design based on computational intelligence, such as

robust inferential sensors, process optimization based on empirical emulators, automated

operating discipline, and accelerated fundamental model building. He holds a US patent

and has published more than 70 papers and 14 book chapters in the area of applied

computational intelligence and advanced analytics. Recently he published the book

Applying Computational Intelligence, published by Springer and is a co-author of the book

Applied Data Mining for Forecasting, published by SAS Press.
