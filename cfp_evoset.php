 <h2>Nature-inspired algorithms in Software Engineering and Testing</h2>
<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>
<?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?>

<p>We seek both theoretical developments and applications of Computational Intelligence to the design, the development, operation, and maintenance of software, with particular focus on testing for security and reliability. All bio-inspired computational paradigms are welcome, mainly Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, including Multi-Objective Approaches, but also Fuzzy Logic, Intelligent Agent Systems, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, Artificial Immune Systems, Swarm Intelligence and others, including hybrids.

Topics include but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements engineering  </li>
<li>Automated design and development of software</li>
<li>Search-based software engineering</li>
<li>Software reliability, testing and security</li>
<li>Software maintenance and self-repair</li>
<li>Software effort estimation and fault prediction</li>
<li>Genetic improvement of software</li>
<li>Real world applications of the above</li>
