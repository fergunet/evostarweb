<h3>Application deadline:  20 February 2017</h3>
 
<p>A limited number of student travel bursaries will be available to those whose papers have been accepted for EuroGP, EvoCOP, EvoMUSART and EvoAPPLICATIONS 2017.  We aim to offer assistance to as many students as possible and <span class="red" style="font-weight:bold;">applications will only be accepted from those who have already registered for the EvoStar conferences</span>.  Do not apply for an EvoStar bursary until you have completed the registration process, otherwise your application will be automatically rejected.  
 </p>
 <p>
Providing support for conference travel is meant to make it easier for individuals to obtain additional funding from their own institution, or from other sources.  <strong>Travel bursaries</strong> are principally designed for students travelling inter-continental distances from outside Europe.  Claims are made after the conference and require original travel tickets/boarding passes to be submitted with a claim form, for reimbursement in April. 
 </p>
 <p>
We are trying to support as many EvoStar participants as possible with limited funds so please be realistic in your expectations of the support that can be offered.
 </p>
