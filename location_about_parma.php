        <h2>About <span class="red">Parma</span></h2>
   </div>


   <p>Parma is located in northern Italy, in Emilia-Romagna, halfway between Bologna and
   Milan.</p>
   <p>Parma is an elegant city with a refined atmosphere, inherited from its 18th century
   legacy with the French royal family (the central Parco Ducale reproduces the design of
   the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris), that can only be breathed in a “petite capitale”. With
   its center rich of art, parks and treasures from different ages, Parma is a very
   welcoming place.</p>
   <p>
   Parma is known for its gastronomic heritage, has been selected as “food creativity
   town” by UNESCO, and is world-famous for products like Parmigiano Reggiano
   cheese and Parma ham.</p>
