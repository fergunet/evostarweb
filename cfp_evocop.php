    <p>Part of Evo<span class="red">*</span> 2019 (<a href="http://www.evostar.org">http://www.evostar.org</a>) 
      including: Euro<span class="red">GP</span>, Evo<span class="red">COP</span>, Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span> and 
      Evo<span class="red">Applications</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>The 19th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial
Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers
working on evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for
solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various
industrial, economic, and scientific domains. Prominent examples of
metaheuristics include: evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution
algorithms, swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm
optimisation, local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search,
variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path
relinking, and their hybridisation, such as memetic algorithms. Automatic
algorithm configuration and design, meta-optimisation, model-based methods, and
hyperheuristics are also topics of interest. Successfully solved problems
include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and
stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design,
transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, graph problems,
satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, and planning problems.</p>


<p>
The EvoCOP 2019 conference will be held in the city of Leipzing, Germany,
together with EuroGP (the 22nd European Conference on Genetic Programming),
EvoMUSART (the 8th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired
music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 22nd European Conference
on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively
known as EvoStar (Evo*).

    <h3>Publication Details</h3>
EvoCOP 2019 will accept three types of submissions:

<h4>Regular papers</h4>
<p>Regular papers will be presented orally at the conference and printed in the
proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series (see LNCS volumes 2037,
2279, 2611, 3004, 3448, 3906, 4446, 4972, 5482, 6022, 6622, 7245, 7832, 8600,
9026, 9595, 10197 and 10782 for the previous proceedings).</p>

<p>
The best regular paper presented at EvoCOP 2019 will be distinguished with a
*Best Paper Award*. Authors of the best regular papers will be invited for fast
track publication in the *Evolutionary Computation Journal*. The invited
submissions must significantly extend the conference paper and will undergo
peer review.
</p>


<h4>Reproducibility studies</h4>
<p>Reproducibility studies are concise and rigorous experimental studies that
replicate published experiments, and that substantially shift the confidence in
the main results of the original study. We strongly encourage the authors to
discuss the reasons for the new findings, such as, e.g., input data not
considered in the original work or different implementation details.
A reproducibility study should follow the usual reproducibility standards, that
is, it should provide complete details about the implementation, compiler
options, input data description, algorithmic parameters, operating system and
hardware specification.  Moreover, the code should be available in a public
repository immediately after the submission to EvoCOP and should remain
available after publication in the proceedings. Statistical analysis, if
applicable, should provide details about the statistical assumptions and
statistical testing procedures.  Although it is expected that textual
similarity between the reproducibility study and the original work may arise,
the usual plagiarism standards will be taken into account.  Reproducibility
studies will take the form of short papers presented orally at the conference
and published in the Springer LNCS proceedings.</p>


<h4>Late breaking abstracts</h4>
<p>Late-breaking abstracts (LBAs) summarise ongoing research, recent studies and
applications of evolutionary computation and other meta-heuristics to real-world
or academic combinatorial optimisation problems. LBAs will be presented as short
talks during the conference.
</p>

    <h3>Submission Details</h3>
<p>Paper submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. The submissions
will be peer reviewed by members of the program committee. The authors of
accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers'
comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts.
At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference,
attend the conference and present the work.</p>
<p>
The reviewing process will be double-blind, please omit information about the
authors in the submitted paper. Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format.
