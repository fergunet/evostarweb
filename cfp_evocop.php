    <p>The 19th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in
Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that
brings together researchers working on evolutionary computation
methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial
optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and
scientific domains. Prominent examples of metaheuristics include:
evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms, swarm
intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm
optimisation, local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu
search, variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter
search and path relinking, and their hybridisation, such as memetic
algorithms. Automatic algorithm configuration and design,
meta-optimisation, model-based methods, and hyperheuristics are also
topics of interest. Successfully solved problems include, but are not
limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic
problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design,
transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, graph problems,
satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, and planning
problems.</p>


<p>
The EvoCOP 2019 conference will be held in the city of Parma, Italy. 
It will be held in conjunction with EuroGP (the 22nd European
Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (8th European conference on
evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and
EvoApplications (the 22nd European Conference on the Applications of
Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar
(Evo*).

meta-heuristics to real-world or academic combinatorial optimisation
problems. LBAs will be presented as posters during the conference.
</p>

    <p><strong>Submission Details</strong></p>
<p>Regular paper submissions must be original and not published
elsewhere. The submissions will be peer reviewed by members of the
program committee. The authors of accepted papers will have to improve
their paper on the basis of the reviewers' comments and will be asked
to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts. At least one
author of each accepted work has to register for the conference,
attend the conference and present the work.</p>
<p>
The reviewing process will be double-blind, please omit information
about the authors in the submitted paper. Submit your manuscript in
Springer LNCS format.
