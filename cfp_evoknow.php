This track, organized under the aegis of the H2020 FET-OPEN project
<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/196968_en.html">"PHOENIX: Exploring the Unknown through Reincarnation and Co-
evolution"</a>, aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from
all application domains dealing with the incorporation of knowledge into
evolutionary techniques. We seek high-quality contributions focused on
multi-disciplinary approaches combining Evolutionary Computation,
knowledge representation, knowledge transfer, case-based reasoning,
and real-world applications thereof. Topics of interest include but are not
limited to:

<ul>
<li>Incorporation of domain knowledge into evolutionary algorithms</li>
<li>Novel techniques to identify and elicit explicit and/or implicit expert knowledge relevant to evolutionary algorithms</li>
<li>Innovative knowledge representation strategies for Evolutionary Computation</li>
<li>Case-based reasoning applied to evolutionary algorithms</li>
<li>Knowledge transfer across applications and domains</li>
<li>Methods to account for uncertainties and contradictions in knowledge</li>
<li>Knowledge-informed surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms</li>
<li>Lifetime learning and Interactive Evolutionary Computation</li>
<li>Memetic computing and domain-specific evolutionary techniques</li>
<li>Real-world applications of knowledge-based Evolutionary Computation</li>

</ul>


<h3>SUBMISSION DETAILS</h3>
<p>Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be
peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information
about the authors in the submitted paper.</p>

<p>Submit your manuscript in <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">Springer LNCS format</a>.</p>

<p>Please provide up to five keywords in your Abstract</p>

<p>Page limit: 16 pages.</p>



<h3>PUBLICATION DETAILS</h3>
<p>Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of EvoStar, published in a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 
which will be available at the Conference. The authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers 
comments and will be asked to send a camera ready version of their manuscripts. At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the 
conference and attend the conference and present the work.</p>
