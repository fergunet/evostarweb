<h2>21th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation</h2>

<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>

 <p>Evo<span class="red">Applications</span></a></span>, 
      the European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation 
      -formerly known as EvoWorkshops- brings together researchers in a variety 
      of areas of application of Evolutionary Computation and other Nature-inspired 
      techniques. </p>
    <p> <span id="logo">Evo<span class="red">Applications</span>
      invites high quality contributions for its 21st edition, which will be held 
      as part of the Evo<span class="red">Star</span>
      2018 event in Parma, Italy, April 2018 and co-located within Evo<span class="red">Star</span> 
      with three related conferences: <a href="cfp_eurogp.html">Euro<span class="red">GP</span></a>, <a href="cfp_evocop.html">Evo<span class="red">COP</span></a> 
      and <a href="cfp_evomusart.html">Evo<span class="red">MUSART</span></a>.<br />
      </span> </p>

     <!-- <strong><p>An extended version of the EvoAPPLICATIONS best papers will be published in a special issue of <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/12293">Memetic Computing</a> (Impact Factor: 1.00)</p></strong>
