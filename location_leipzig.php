        <h2>Getting to <span class="red">Leipzig</span></h2>
   </div>


Most people attending EvoStar 2019 from abroad will probably either fly to Leipzig, or go to
Germany’s main airports Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin, and travel by train or bus from there to
Leipzig.

<h3>By plane:</h3>
The Leipzig/Halle airport is located 18 km to the north-west from Leipzig. There are direct flights to
international destinations, such as Vienna, Zurich, London, Istanbul and Moscow, while many other
European and worldwide destinations are easy to reach via the German hubs of Frankfurt (6 times a
day) and Munich (4 times a day). There are also connecting flights to other German cities, such as
Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Cologne/Bonn.
Once you have landed in Leipzig, it is most convenient to go by train to the Main Station and the city
center. It takes about 12 minutes.

<h3>By car:</h3>
Situated at the junction between the A9 (Berlin - Munich), A14 (Dresden - Magdeburg) and A38
(Leipzig - Göttingen) motorways mean that Leipzig is centrally placed within the German motorway
network. There is direct access from the motorway junctions to the various parts of the city. We
recommend the following routes into the city center:
<ul>
<li>From Berlin and Magdeburg: approach on the A14, leaving at junction &#39;Leipzig-Mitte&#39; (Leipzig City
Centre)</li>
<li>From Dresden: approach on the A14, leaving at junction &#39;Leipzig-Ost&#39; (Leipzig East)</li>
<li>From Munich and Erfurt: approach on the A38, leaving at junction &#39;Leipzig - Südwest&#39; (Leipzig South
West)</li>
</ul>
