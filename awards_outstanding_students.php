<h2>Evo<span class="red">Star</span> Outstanding Students 2019 </h2>
</div>
<p>
 We have selected our Outstanding Students of Evo* 2019 because of the high quality of their contributions.
</p>
<p>
As well as recognition on the Evo* web page and a certificate of their merit, we wanted to offer them the opportunity to run for the Evo* Best Student Paper 2019 prize.
In order to do this, selected students will need to present a poster at the poster reception on Wednesday 24th April, in addition to their respective talks. The winner and runner up will be decided by the votes from the audience.
