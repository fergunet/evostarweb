<h2>Evolutionary and Bio-Inspired Computational Techniques within Real-World Industrial and Commercial Environments.</h2>
<?php include('common_to_all.php') ?>
<?php include('common_to_apps.php') ?>

Evolutionary and Bio-Inspired Computation has established itself as a powerful technique for design, search and optimisation with applications in areas such as routing, scheduling, timetabling and planning.  There are a number of challenges in moving from academic research to use within industrial environments, these challenges are not only technical, but may also encompass issues such as user interaction and adoption within organisations. EvoIndustry seeks contributions from researchers, developers and industrialists who have utilised Evolutionary Computation within an industrial context.
Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
<li>Case studies on the adoption of Evolutionary Computation within organisations, examining hard and soft issues</li>
<li>Hybrid methods and novel heuristics developed to solve specific problems</li>
<li>The handling of real-world soft constraints</li>
<li>The construction of user interfaces to allow non-experts to use evolutionary based techniques</li>
<li>Organisation, resource and workforce scheduling</li>
<li>Scheduling and planning in industrial environments including production planning, transportation and distribution</li>
</ul>
